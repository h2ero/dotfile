Version 1.0.3.3

Changes in this version
- Removed hard coded breakpoint colors, using a default scheme
- Fixed bug in viewing associative array names / children
- Fixed bug in restoring MiniBufExplorer on quit
- Added a global flag to optionally disable default mappings (if you don't want the plugin to hijack function keys)
- Added plugin folder support for Pathogen setups
- Added a global flag to disable the help pane (since you've memorized your mappings and want more screen real estate)
